                Hi there! I started my Fullstack Web Development journey in September in 2023. I'm about to graduate my bootcamp with a certificate from University of California, Irvine. In this program I learned a lot.
                <p>
                 In the first 2 months of the program, I learned how to use HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also learned how to make an application programming interface call through third-parties, server-side, and web. I also learned how to use Github and deploy a webpage. In the next two months, I learned how to use Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Object-relational Mapping, and Object-oriented programming.
                 These last two months, I've learned some basic Computer Science and regex, NoSQL(mongoose), progressive web applications, React.js, MERN, and State.
                 </p>
